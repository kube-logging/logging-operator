# [Throttle Filter](https://github.com/rubrikinc/fluent-plugin-throttle)
## Overview
 A sentry plugin to throttle logs. Logs are grouped by a configurable key. When a group exceeds a configuration rate, logs are dropped for this group.

## Configuration
## Throttle

### group_bucket_limit (int, optional) {#throttle-group_bucket_limit}

Maximum number logs allowed per groups over the period of group_bucket_period_s

Default: 6000

### group_bucket_period_s (int, optional) {#throttle-group_bucket_period_s}

This is the period of of time over which group_bucket_limit applies

Default: 60

### group_drop_logs (bool, optional) {#throttle-group_drop_logs}

When a group reaches its limit, logs will be dropped from further processing if this value is true

Default: true

### group_key (string, optional) {#throttle-group_key}

Used to group logs. Groups are rate limited independently

Default: kubernetes.container_name

### group_reset_rate_s (int, optional) {#throttle-group_reset_rate_s}

After a group has exceeded its bucket limit, logs are dropped until the rate per second falls below or equal to group_reset_rate_s.

Default: group_bucket_limit/group_bucket_period_s

### group_warning_delay_s (int, optional) {#throttle-group_warning_delay_s}

When a group reaches its limit and as long as it is not reset, a warning message with the current log rate of the group is emitted repeatedly. This is the delay between every repetition.

Default: 10 seconds
