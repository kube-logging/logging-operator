## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [Logging Operator](https://github.com/kube-logging/logging-operator) deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.19+

## Installing CRDs

Use `createCustomResource=false` with Helm v3 to avoid trying to create CRDs from the `crds` folder and from templates at the same time.

## Installing Fluentd and Fluent-bit via logging

The chart does **not** install `logging` resource to deploy Fluentd (or Syslog-ng) and Fluent-bit on the cluster by default, but
it can be enabled by setting the `logging.enabled` value to true.
