# Liveness probe is aimed to help in situarions where fluentd
# silently hangs for no apparent reasons until manual restart.
# The idea of this probe is that if fluentd is not queueing or
# flushing chunks for 5 minutes, something is not right. If
# you want to change the fluentd configuration, reducing amount of
# logs fluentd collects, consider changing the threshold or turning
# liveness probe off completely.
